<!-- 1. How fast was this sort? Fast, slow, medium? -->

-Slow.

<!-- 2. Did you require any extra space besides the space that the cards were originally laid out in? -->

- No.

<!-- 3. What effect did it have on the end result that you did not swap "ties" (e.g., a 5 of hearts and a 5 of diamonds)? -->

none,it will just leave them in order they were


<!-- 4. How fast or slow would it be to sort cards that start out already in order? -->

i will just have to check one time two by two cards to see if the order is correct,it will be fast,because they are in the correct order.


<!-- 5. How fast or slow would it be to sort cards that start out in completely reversed order? -->

it will be slow to put them in the correct order

<!-- 6. Hypothetically, if you wanted to sort by suits (e.g., clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades) and then by card value, how would your swap/comparison logic change? -->

-if you want to sort by suits first,you have to use an unstable sort and then next,you use a stable sort to sort them numerically

<!-- 7. Given your answers to the previous questions, hazard a guess at what this sort's stats are: -->
<!-- 
    * Best-case time complexity (Big Ω) -->

    Ω(N)

    <!-- * Worst-case time complexity (Big O) -->
    O(N^2)

    <!-- * Space complexity? (Big O) -->
    O(1)
    
    <!-- * Is this a stable or unstable sort? -->
    stable
